# VirtualPCCpp

This is a simulation of a fully fledged PC. It includes its own CPU, GPU, HDD and RAM (soon ROM aka BIOS integration). CPU/GPU architectures are designed by me. CPU operates on 32bit architecture while the GPU operates on a 16bit architecture(Subject to change for GPU). Memmory adressing is up to 24bits so there is total of 16MB of RAM and VRAM (16 each). Example programs included in the repo such as Bubble sort, print characters to screen and basic operations. CUrrently there is an Assembly language for the CPU (Everything about it can be read in Assembly Documentation.txt) and for the GPU (subject to change). Currently working on a C-Like language for the CPU. **Main branch i am working on is Reworked right now, latest commits are on it. I will merge them *soon***
