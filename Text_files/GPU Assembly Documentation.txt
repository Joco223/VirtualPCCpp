You can set jump postions for jmp instructions

forward:

You define jump positions by typing the name of it and putting a colon at the end of it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can do regA...regL for using register values as arguments for instructions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Instruction set:
--For >move< instructions, first argument is origin data location and second
argument is target data location

move.s - Move 8 bits of data from a register to an adress in memory or move 8
bits of data from an adress in memory to a register (move.s x regA)

move.d - Move 16 bits of data from a register to an adress in memory or move
16 bits of data from an adress in memory to a register (move.d x regA)

move.l - Move 32 bits of data from a register to an adress in memory or move
32 bits of data from an adress in memory to a register (move.l x regA)

--For >moveP.< instructions first argument is pointer (which is stored in a register)
while second argument is the target register (moveP.s.r regA regB), add .r or .w for
reading and writing

moveP.s.r - Read from memory from a pointer

moveP.s.w - Write to memory from a pointer

--For the following instructions you put the register you want to perform on
as the argument

clr - Set a register to 0 (clr regA)

inc - Increment the value in a register (inc regA)

dec - Decrement the value in a register (dec regA)

cot - Display the value in a register to the console (cot regA)

add - Sum two values in two registers, result is stored in the first register
(add regA regB)

mod - Modulo two values in two registers, result is stored in the first register
(mod regA regB)

sub - Subtract two values in two registers, result is stored in the first
register (sub regA regB)

mlt.s - Signed multiplication of values in two registers, result is stored in
first register (mlt.s regA regB)

mlt.u - Unsigned multiplication of values in two registers, result is stored
in first register (mlt.u regA regB)

div.s - Signed integer division of values in two registers, result is stored in first
register (div.s regA regB)

div.u - Unsigned integer division of values in two registers, result is stored in
first register (div.y regA regB)

jmp.z - Jump to given memory adress if value in register is 0 (jmp.z regA
start)

jmp.o - Jump to given memory adress if value in register is 1 (jmp.o regA
start)

jmp.u - Jump to given memory adress, jump is performed no matter the value in
register (jmp.u start)

cmp.s.b - Compare if first register holds a greater value than second register
in signed mode, result is stored in first register (cmp.s.b regA regB)

cmp.s.be - Compare if first register golds a greater or equal value than
second regisrer in signed mode, result is stored in first register (cmp.s.be
regA regB)

cmp.s.e - Compare if first and second register hold the same value, result is
stored in first register (cmp.s.e regA regB)

cmp.u.b - Compare if first register holds a greater value than second register
in unsigned mode, result is stored in first register (cmp.u.b regA regB)

cmp.u.be - Compare if first register golds a greater or equal value than
second register in unsigned mode, result is stored in first register (cmp.u.be
regA regB)

g.IDX - Get task X position (g.IDX regA)

g.IDY - Get task Y position (g.IDY regA)

g.ID - Get task ID (g.ID regA)

displ - Set a color to a pixel on the screen, x position is used from regA, y
position from regB and 3 arguments for color, only registers (displ regC regD regE)

set - Directly aasign value to a register (set regA 543)
