64th commit - 28/12/2017
-GPU is fully programable now, basic instructions available, write your gpu programs in GPU_Program.txt
-When creating GPU in Main.cpp, 3rd and 4th argument is number of X cores and number of Y cores respectively
-cs_out commands, clr_comm and clr_vram have been removed from the cpu

65-66th commit - 30/12/2017
-Changed how GPU cores work, now each one has its own local memory of 256 bytes and it can read/write to it. Support for read only VRAM from the cores is coming soon
-Added task queue to the gpu so you can create as big of a task list which the gpu cores will execute
-You set the task size by using command >kernel_size< in GPU Assembly followed by 2 numbers for x and y size respectively.
-GPU Assembly documentation coming soon

67th committ - 31/12/2017
-Added instructions to CPU and GPU Cores to access VRam, CPU can read/write to it while GPU cores can only read from it
-Added min and max instructions to the GPU Cores and they take 3 arguments, its meant to be used for triangle drawing
-Added a signed register 0 bigger or equal to register 1 instruction to GPU Cores, written as reg0_be_s, other ones coming soon
-Made a very basic GPU program to draw a triangle to the screen
