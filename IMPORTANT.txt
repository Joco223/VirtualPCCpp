Currently changing the way programs are compiled.
Now you have to run CPU_Compiler.exe (Compilers/CPU_Compiler) in command line with two arguments,
first is the input .sal file and the second is output name (CPU_Compiler.exe 8bitNumber.sal Test)
Then, you take the newly created Test.cbc, take it to directory where vPC.exe is, and then when you
run the vPC, it will ask you for the .cbc file, enter it and it is done, it will run the program.
Current missing features:
-No GPU Compiler

Because of instruction set changes, recompile your programs! Now Ram is 64MB, HDD 256MB and vRam 128MB. Have fun :)

No HDD.txt file included in the commit because it is too big currently, run CrateHDD.cbc program to create one
I will make the file size smaller soon™

To load data into HDD without opening the text file, in HDD_Loader, run HDD_Loader.exe with arguments, which .txt file
is the HDD, which one is the data you want to put into the HDD and and memory position where the data will begin from
(HDD_Loader.exe HDD.txt Test.exe 0). Wait a bit for it to say "Finished..." before closing the program, the HDD.txt will
appear before that but wait until it is fully completed.
