64th commit - 28/12/2017
-GPU is fully programable now, basic instructions available, write your gpu programs in GPU_Program.txt

65-66th commit - 30/12/2017
-Changed how GPU cores work, now each one has its own local memory of 256 bytes and it can read/write to it. Support for read only VRAM from the cores is coming soon
-Added task queue to the gpu so you can create as big of a task list which the gpu cores will execute
-You set the task size by using command >kernel_size< in GPU Assembly followed by 2 numbers for x and y size respectively.
-GPU Assembly documentation coming soon
